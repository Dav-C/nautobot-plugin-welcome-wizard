# What is the Nautobot Welcome Wizard?

The Welcome Wizard is a getting started wizard for [Nautobot](https://nautobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to assist a new user with necessary initial steps in populating data.

## Key Features

The Welcome Wizard adds four (4) key features:

1. [**Import Wizard**](import_wizard.md) - Welcome Wizard uses the `Import Wizard` to allow ease of adding community defined Device Types and Manufacturers into Nautobot.

2. [**Quick-Start Settings**](git_datasource.md) - Welcome Wizard includes settings that are enabled by default to ease the user in setting up and syncing from a GitRepository.

3. [**Helpful Middleware**](middleware.md) - Welcome Wizard includes middleware banners to assist with Nautobot resource creation.

4. [**Getting Started Dashboard**](dashboard.md) - The Getting Started Dashboard contains a list of common Nautobot Data Models that many other Nautobot models require. This page allows ease of adding items to Nautobot or, if supported, importing them. This ties all of the features together.

## Supported Python Versions

Welcome Wizard supports Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8.
